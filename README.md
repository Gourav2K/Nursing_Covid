# Nursing_Covid
During the Coronavirus disease 2019-20 (COVID-19) outbreak in the United States, nursing homes became the hotbed for the spread of COVID-19. States developed different policies to mitigate the COVID-19 risks at nursing homes, including limiting nursing home visitation and mandating staff screening. The purpose of this study is to examine whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the nursing home reported quality. We will determine U.S. nursing home characteristics that allow the prediction of COVID-19 cases and deaths including the development of a predictive model.
